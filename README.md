This code repository contains all the code used for the paper "Interaction Testing in Variation Analysis". To reproduce the results of the paper, you can follow the steps:

1. Download the necessary data from this [data link](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/5d4a2tqjy5rn73xesalir/AKHTU_oieip9-XBaFRP9954?rlkey=s0tt1oymkhil2pql36wvaf5td&st=vwlg0gon&dl=0), and place the data into the `data/` folder.
2. Install any necessary R dependencies (the list of the used R packages can be seen in `r/zzz-deps.R`).
3. For reproducing synthetic experiments (Figures 4 & 8), run the script `scripts/ia-synthetic.R`).
4. For reproducing the real data experiments (Table 3), run the script `scripts/ia-in-the-wild.R`).
